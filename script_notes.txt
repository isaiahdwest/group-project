- Project title
- Our names
====================


SCRIPT:
"Good morning, my name is Daniel McBride, and I, along with Shweta Agrawal, Tony Tedesco, and Isaiah Westphalen, would like to welcome you all here today.  Whether you are an established business leader or have the potential to be one in the future, we have devised a special place to help assist you with your decision making for not only your business' success but also for the benefit of your employees."

"It's not surprising to know the Covid-19 pandemic has effected almost every single aspect of existence for individuals, businesses, and governments around the globe.  More specifically, the levels of employment in nearly every single job market has taken massive hits due to layoffs, illness, and business closures, causing major disruptions to profits but also, most importantly, our well-being."

"The future is indeed still uncertain, but history can also enlighten us on how we can move forward."

====================


SCRIPT:
"With that being said, our team decided to embark on a journey to discover how we can peer in to the future and determine how employment levels in various job markets will recover or further suffer from the pandemic as more and more vaccines go out to hopefully help bring us back to some sense of normalcy once again."

+ THE APPLICATION +
+++++++++++++++++++


====================
(((Switch to browser tab with web application)))
====================


SCRIPT:
"We created a online destination accessible to anyone to better understand both the historical trends of how employment levels have changeed in some major job markets as well as look in to the crystal ball and see how those same employment levels will shift up or down based on what has come before.  We believe it is important to understand what these job markets will not only shape our economic future, but also the future of those hit with occupational hardships recently and are looking for a path that moves them past and beyond."

"Through our link (which we are sending out now) you can access our page right now and explore a specific job market, such as retail, construction, or mining, and visually see how employment levels have fluxuated in the past, either by an actual number of employees per job market or the month by month rate of change in employment levels.  Here you can notice how historical events, such as market crashes, recessions, and even global pandemics have shaped the day to day lives of both employees and employers.  Using a machine learning model, you can also see how those employment levels are forecasted to change in the future, both if the coronavirus potentially never existed and also taking in to account the major disruption caused by Covid-19."

"To provide you with a bit of insight into how this was possible, we will explore under the hood of our vehicle to see how this engine was built."

+ THE DATA +
++++++++++++


====================
(((Slide #3 - The Data)))
- screenshot of FRED website(?)
====================


SCRIPT:
"We first collected economic data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, which has been a trusted source of data since 1991.  Thanks to our colleague, Tony Tedesco, who discovered this wealth of insightful knowledge, we collected monthly data that stretched as far back as 1975 in 30 categories, such as the unemployment rate, personal saving rate, dollar amounts of real estate loans, and of course, our target job markets, including leisure and hospitality, education and health, and manufacturing to name a few."


====================
(((Slide #4 - The Data)))
- list of some of the exogenous features ("unemployment rate(percentage)", "personal saving rate(percentage)", "real estate loans(dollar amounts)", "...")
- list of some of the target features ("leisure/hospitality(number for persons)", "education/health(number for persons)", "manufacturing(number for persons)", "...")
====================


SCRIPT:
"After some consultation and initial exploration of the data, we decided to create a Time Series model that would allow us to forecast into the future.  It was important to ensure our data, across all categories, had a consistent date for this model to work.  This did require us to abandon some extra data that was only available quarterly as well as more recent data that had only begun being recorded in the mid 90s or early 2000s.  This would ensure we had a abundant sample size of data with consistent dates."


++++++++++++++++
+ THE ANALYSIS +
++++++++++++++++


====================
(((Slide #5 - The Analysis)))
- Plot: Government Social benefits to persons (unemployment insurance) & unemployment rates
====================


SCRIPT:
"To gain a deeper understanding of our data, we developed some visualizations to actually see how our data has changed over time and how certain features related to each other.  The extraordinarily brilliant Shweta took charge utilizing Tableau for our exploratory data analysis."

"In one example, U.S. government paid out unemployment benefits of roughly $1.4 trillion in March of 2020.  The recession of 2008 in comparison only saw a payout of roughly $200 billion.  At the same time in March of 2020, the unemployment rate went to an all time of around 15% but shortly came down to roughly 6% afterwards."


====================
(((Slide #6 - The Analysis)))
- Plot: Target retail & target leisure hospitality
====================


SCRIPT:
"Retail has had a fairly decent recovery following March 2020 while leisure and hospitality, which saw around a 50% drop in employment levels, is still struggling to return to a familiar trend in employment levels at a time before March of 2020."


====================
(((Slide #7 - The Analysis)))
- Plot: Mining & manufacturing
====================


SCRIPT:
"Mining and logging saw a peak in employment levels way back in the early to mid 80s but has not seen that kind of employment since then, with only a slight boom coming after the 2008 recession.  The road to recovery after Covid-19 does not seem to be trending very well either.  Manufacturing seemed to be pretty consistent up until the early 2000s, in which a significant drop in employment levels has been prevalent since then, regardless of the effects of the pandemic."


====================
(((Slide #8 - The Analysis)))
- Plot: the last 4 targets together (construction, edu/health, business services, government)
====================


SCRIPT:
"Our final visual shows our remaining target categories that we will be forecasting, all of which follow a similar upward trend with slight disruptions to employment levels occuring at roughly the same point in time."


+++++++++++++
+ THE MODEL +
+++++++++++++


====================
(((Slide #9 - The Model)))
- "Vector Autoregression(VAR): A time series model that takes in multiple predictors over time(including the target value(s)) and can forcast a multivariate output."
====================


SCRIPT:
"After exploring our data and determining our goals, we decided that a Time Series model would align with our objectives the best.  The incredibly talented Tony Tedesco headed up our modeling efforts with the discovery of the Vector Autoregression model, that would allow us have a multivariate output as opposed to a univariate output.  This would allow us pull out forecasts for all 8 of our targets with one model, saving us from creating 8 different models for each variable."


====================
(((Slide #10 - The Model)))
- "Endogenous vs. Exogenous"
====================


"One of the main concepts to understand to gain a better interpretation of how this model works is endogenous features vs exogenous features.  Endogenous features represents the variables that we are looking to forecast or predict.  In this type of model, those same features are also used to help train the model in their chronological order.  The remaining data, which is also used to help train the model but not being forecast, is consider to exogenous features."


====================
(((Slide #11 - The Model)))
- "Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test"
- "Stationary Data vs. Non-Stationary Data"
- "Making data stationary by takes away the trend by calculating the discrete difference along a given axis (similar to scaling data)"
====================


"Now the data also needs a form of scaling to be effective with this model, and in this situation, we are required to remove the trend from the data by calculating the discrete difference along a given axis.  This is also called making the data stationary, and we are able to check to see if our data is already stationary or needs to be made stationary by implementing an Augmented Dickey-Fuller test.  After our first test, the majority of our target data was non-stationary, so we transformed the data by calculating the discrete difference, and a follow-up test showed that all of our target data was now stationary and ready for modeling."


====================
(((Slide #12 - The Model)))
- "Forecasting Predictions"
- A screenshot or table of a dataframe with forecasted predictions for all targets with the DATE index (n steps/months in to the future)
====================


"Once the model is fitted on our endogenous and exogenous data, we are able to specify the amount of time we want to forecast into the future, also known as our steps.  Because our data was originally filtered monthly, each step indicates one month into the future.  After playing with the code a little bit, we can actually visualize our forecasted predictions for each target category with ease."


====================
(((Slide #13 - The Model)))
- "The Metrics"
- RMSE/MSE metric information
====================


"Being a regression model, we utilized mean squared error as our metric to determine how well our model was potentially performing at predicting the future."


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+ PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER +
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++


====================
(((Slide #14 - Putting it all Together)))
- "Flask is a web framework written in python."
- "We used flask to create our web app"
====================


SCRIPT:
"Now that we had a working model, we discussed how best we could package this model to our audience in an interactive and interpretable way.  With the unrivaled genius of Isaiah leading the charge, we were able to build out our web app utilizing Flask, a web framework written in python that can utilize code along with html, css, and javascript for design and functionality of our application."


====================
(((Slide #15 - Putting it all Together)))
- ""Heroku is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud." - quote from heroku.com"
====================


"In order to make our web app accessible to anyone around the globe, we used Heroku, which is a platform as a service that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.  This allows our model to exist in an online space while still allowing us to make updates, upgrades, or debug at anytime in real time."


++++++++++++++++++
+ THE CONCLUSION +
++++++++++++++++++


====================
(((Slide #16 - Conclusion & Limitations)))
- "Unpredictability cause by Covid-19"
- "Truncated data for Covid-19"
- "Model is still a good indicator of the future"
====================


SCRIPT:
"Covid-19 has been an unexpected outlier in both our data and our daily lives.  We did decided to also truncated our data to omit the turbulence caused by the pandemic, primarily out of our own curiosity, to see how our forecasts would react.  We determined that even with the majority of the data breaking most trend lines around March of 2020, our model still performed as a good indicator of the future."


====================
(((Slide #17 - Next Steps)))
- "Testing different models (Neural Networks)"
- "The Passage of Time"
====================


SCRIPT:
"We would like to further refine our application by testing out different types of models and their potential outputs, such as the potential implementation of neural networks.  Also, creating a scheduled, automated ETL data pipeline to bring in new data as it becomes available can help ensure the future functionality of our application by consistently bringing that new data into the model."

"The natural passage of time will ultimately be the best test of our performance, but we hope that with the forecasted findings created by our model and the accessibility to you through our web app for which ever field of business you seek to thrive in, you can gain better insight into the business decisions you make and direction you take for any specific point in your future, particularly when it comes to recovering from the disruption caused by Covid-19 and helping to get individuals back to work and building our futures together again."
